# Implementation Roadmap: Performance, Testing, and TypeScript Support

This roadmap is adapted to the current state of the sera-js/sera project and outlines the actionable steps and milestones for the upcoming enhancements.

---

## 1. Performance Optimization

- **Benchmark Current State**
  - Profile current JavaScript code for bottlenecks and inefficiencies.
  - Record baseline performance metrics.

- **Optimize Signal Propagation Logic**
  - Review and refactor the core reactivity system for efficiency.
  - Minimize redundant computations and DOM updates.

- **Memory Management**
  - Audit current data structures for unnecessary allocations.
  - Implement improvements to reduce memory and resource usage.

- **Performance Tooling**
  - Integrate performance profiling tools.
  - Add documentation or scripts for profiling.

---

## 2. Test Coverage Improvements

- **Testing Audit**
  - Review existing tests to determine coverage and quality.
  - Identify untested modules and critical code paths.

- **Expand Unit and Integration Tests**
  - Add tests for core reactivity and signal mechanisms.
  - Cover edge cases and potential failure modes.

- **End-to-End (E2E) Test Scenarios**
  - Develop E2E tests for common usage patterns.

- **Coverage Reporting**
  - Integrate code coverage tools (e.g., Coveralls, Codecov) into CI.
  - Set up coverage thresholds and reporting.

- **Testing Documentation**
  - Document testing setup, how to run tests, and contribution guidelines.

---

## 3. Comprehensive TypeScript Integration

- **TypeScript Setup**
  - Review and update `tsconfig.json` for strict settings.
  - Set up build scripts for TypeScript compilation.
  - Ensure existing config files are correctly set up.

- **Incremental Migration**
  - Prioritize migration of core modules to TypeScript.
  - Gradually migrate the rest of the codebase.
  - Fix type errors and introduce type safety.

- **Type Definitions**
  - Ensure all public APIs are typed.
  - Publish or bundle type definitions for consumers.

- **TypeScript Testing**
  - Add and run type-specific tests/examples.

- **Documentation**
  - Update README and docs with TypeScript usage and migration status.

---

## Milestones

1. **Audit & Benchmarking**
   - Assess current performance, testing, and TypeScript state.
2. **Performance Refactor**
   - Optimize reactivity and memory usage.
3. **Test Coverage Expansion**
   - Strengthen test suite and CI reporting.
4. **TypeScript Migration**
   - Complete full migration and API typings.
5. **Documentation & Review**
   - Update docs and finalize integration.
