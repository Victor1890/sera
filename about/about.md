Hey hey! I'm **Nazmul Hossain**, the brain 🧠 behind **OlovaJS**, **OlovaKit**
(the supercharged ⚡️ version of Olova), and now the magical 🧙‍♂️ **SeraJS** —
just **1.25KB** and **125 lines** of pure power. 😎

## 💩 The Toilet Tale — How It All Started

Once upon a time... in a toilet 🚽 (yes, for real 😅), I was thinking about
React. Funny thing? I had **zero** experience in React. Not even a single line
of code!

All I knew back then was:

- HTML 🧱
- CSS 🎨
- WordPress PHP 🐘

And yet, there I was, dreaming of building a **JavaScript library under 100
bytes** 🤯 that works like React...

But wait — I didn’t even know what React actually _is_ 🤷‍♂️:

- ❓ What’s Virtual DOM?
- ❓ What’s Fiber?
- ❓ What the heck is a reconciliation algorithm?

That was back in **2019**.

## 🧠 The Learning Era

Then I kinda... forgot that dream 😂 and jumped into learning JavaScript
seriously.

A _lot_ happened (but I’m too lazy to mention everything here 😎).

Fast forward to **2023**, I built my **first JS library**: `DeshiJS` 🇧🇩 — kinda
like `AlpineJS` or `htmx`.

From there, things snowballed:

- I learned about compilers 🛠️
- Discovered Babel, Webpack, Rollup, Vite, Turbopack ⚙️
- Got deep into how frontend frameworks _actually_ work under the hood 🔍

And BOOM 💥:

- I created **OlovaJS** 🫧
- Then **OlovaKit** 🚀
- And now... **SeraJS** 🧬

## 🛠️ Tooling, AI & Bugs (oh my!)

Along the way, I also built a bunch of CLIs and compilers using Node.js —
without having _any idea_ what I was doing at first 😅.

But then... I met **AI** 🤖 — and that changed _everything_.

AI helped me:

- Learn faster ⚡️
- Fix bugs 🐛
- Explore new ideas 🧪

By **March 2025**, I started working on **SeraJS**. Now it’s finally complete 🎉
(well... kinda — still some bugs 😬).

I really hope some kind contributors will help out, 'cause honestly... I still
suck at JavaScript 😂
