# Update Notes: New Features Added

This update brings several key improvements and optimizations to the lightweight JSX library:

1️⃣ **Added Fragment Symbol Support (JSX only)**

* Supports JSX `<></>` fragments internally via the `Fragment` symbol.

2️⃣ **Optimized and More Powerful Component Support**

* Enhanced how function components are processed and optimized for better reactivity and performance.

3️⃣ **Enhanced Children Handling**

* Improved handling of various child types, including arrays, nested arrays, functions (reactive), and primitives, ensuring more robust rendering.

4️⃣ **Optimized JSX Function**

* Streamlined the `jsx` function for better performance, including smarter prop handling, SVG namespace support, and efficient updates.

5️⃣ **Size Optimization**

* The overall library size has been reduced, with the gzipped size now at approximately **800 bytes**, making it even more lightweight and competitive.

These updates focus on making the library more powerful, efficient, and closer to the behavior of mature JSX-based frameworks.
