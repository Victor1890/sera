## ⚙️ **Core Concepts**

### 🔄 **Signal-Based Reactivity**

SeraJS uses a **signal-based reactive system**, a modern approach to state
management that enables efficient updates:

- 🧠 **Signals**  
  Self-contained reactive values that notify subscribers when they change.

- 🌀 **Effects**  
  Functions that automatically re-execute when their dependencies (signals)  
  change.

- 🧭 **Memo**  
  A memoization helper similar to React's `useMemo`, used to cache the result  
  of a computation based on reactive dependencies to avoid unnecessary
  recalculations.

- 🔬 **Fine-Grained Updates**  
  Only the specific DOM elements affected by state changes are updated,  
  resulting in minimal re-rendering and high performance.

> 💡 **SeraJS is designed to be intuitive, fast, and easy to integrate into any
> project — making it a perfect choice for modern frontend development.**


## Why SeraJS?

SeraJS brings together the best parts of libraries like React, Solid, and Lit — blending familiar patterns with a fresh, minimal approach.

At just 1.25KB gzipped and only 135 lines of code, this reactive UI library stays ultra-light while still delivering powerful reactivity.

Whether you want a build system or prefer a no-build workflow, SeraJS has you covered. It’s flexible enough to fit your dev style — use it how *you* want.


## 🌱 **Sera.js Basic Example**

A minimal example showing a Hello World message using Sera.js.

### 📄 App.jsx

```jsx
import { h } from "serajs";

export default function App() {
  return (
    <h1>Hello world</h1>
  );
}
```

## No Build, No Dependencies

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Sera js 😎</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <script type="module">
      import { h, setSignal, setEffect } from "//unpkg.com/serajs";

      function Hello() {
        const [count, setCount] = setSignal(0);

        setEffect(() => {
          console.log(count());
        });

        return h(
          "div",
          null,
          h("h1", null, "Hello World!"),
          h("p", { style: { color: "red" } }, "Do you Like Serajs?"),
          h("h1", null, () => `Count: ${count()}`),
          h(
            "button",
            { onclick: () => setCount(count() + 1) },
            "Increase Count"
          )
        );
      }

      const root = document.body;
      root.appendChild(Hello());
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```
